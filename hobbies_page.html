                        In the past few years since Grace became a mother, she was trying to find some new hobbies she can do from home, and that's when she found her favorite hobby, crochet. She even has a crochet club with her friends where they meet once a week and all talk for hours and crochet together.

                        Grace and her husband have been trying to be more healthy over the past few years, and one of the ways they've found to do this is going on walks. Specifically taking their two kids out on walks whenever they can, whether in their neighborhood, different parks, or even around nearby lakes and popular locations.

                        Grace has always been an avid swimmer even when she was a kid, so when her brother built a pool in his backyard it became a regular occurrance for her and the family to head over there and swim until everyone could not swim any longer.
