                <h3>Short Biography</h3>
                <p>
                    Zheng Huai was born in Guilin, China. A police officer found her wrapped in a pink blanket inside a basket in front of a cement factory, and she still had her umbilical cord attached, so she was less than 10 days old. She was brought to an orphanage and lived there for a year until she was adopted by her new parents John and Jane Dworak. Once her parents came to China and picked her up and brought her home to America, she was given an American name, Katherine Grace-Margaret Dworak. Grace – as she likes to be called – has a special condition where she is missing her fingers on her right hand due to her umbilical cord wrapping around her hand in the womb. Throughout her life she’s had to overcome many struggles due to this, but she’s always excelled at everything she’s done, including learning to play the violin, swim team, and more, all doing so while only being able to use the fingers on one of her hands. Grace graduated from Burke High School and then attended University of Nebraska Omaha for school, where she met her future husband through the religious group she was a part of there. Grace graduated from college with a Bachelor’s degree in Speech Language Pathology, and then a short while later married her husband Michael McNulty and changed her name to Katherine Grace-Margaret McNulty. Within about 4 months of marriage, Grace found out she was pregnant, and several months later had her first baby boy, Henry Joseph McNulty. Shortly after having Henry, Grace started several of her (now) favorite hobbies, outdoor walks and crochet. She still swims on occasion, but generally for fun with her husband and children. About 5 months after giving birth to Henry, Grace found out she was pregnant again, and several months later had another baby boy, Patrick James McNulty. At this point her mother was no longer able to assist her with watching both her kids full time as she had with Henry, so Grace and Michael determined it was time for Grace to do one of her life goals: to be a stay-at-home mom. Grace was nervous that she wouldn’t like staying home with the kids every day even though she’d wanted to do it since she was a teenager, but approached it with enthusiasm as she does with everything in her life, and she ended up being a natural at it and loving it. Grace is currently staying home with 2 kids during the week while her husband works, and she takes the kids out to parks, the Children’s Museum, the Henry Doorly Zoo with other mom and children friends, and is loving life. Grace’s current goals now are to wait until her husband finishes his Bachelor’s degree, then go back to school to be a lactation consultant. Grace has always been a huge proponent of breastfeeding and wants to help other mothers be able to enjoy this amazing experience with their children the way that she has with her own.
